# SnapShare

![SnapShare Preview](site-preview.png)

> SnapShare was created for the exchange students group at Korea University, providing an easy and secure way to share photos and videos from events, trips, and daily life.

SnapShare is a modern, open-source platform for sharing photos and videos in organized folders. It features a secure, privacy-focused backend (NestJS, Prisma, PostgreSQL) and a beautiful, responsive frontend (React, Material UI). SnapShare is ideal for collaborative media sharing, events, or personal collections.

```
[ React Frontend ]  <---->  [ NestJS Backend API ]  <---->  [ PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM ]
```
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material UI, Socket.io client
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Socket.io, AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage (for media), PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Dockerized for local dev)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for full-stack local dev; ready for cloud deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Yarn or npm
- Docker & Docker Compose (for full-stack setup)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snapshare.git
cd snapshare
```

### 2. Local Development (with Docker)
This will start the database, backend, and frontend in one command.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- Frontend: http://localhost:3081
- Backend API: http://localhost:5001
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5433

### 3. Manual Local Setup (without Docker)
#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run start:dev
```
- Runs on http://localhost:3000

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
yarn start # or npm start
```
- Runs on http://localhost:3001

#### Database
- You need a running PostgreSQL instance (see `docker-compose.yml` for env vars)
- Set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`
