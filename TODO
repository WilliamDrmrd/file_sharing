FULLY AUTOMATIC BUG MOST IMPORTANT

    if two pictures same name they get same name in google cloud and override the other
    ==> media.gateway line 35

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOP PRIORITY

    ask name when delete, just ask if they are sure or not, too.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW PRIORITY

    loader when uploading according to the size of the file

    localstorage when password folder.

    add the date in the preview, aswell as size
      means adding size and date to media schema in db, aswell as everywhere else

    add uploader in the preview too
      means adding uploader to media schema in db, as well as everywhere else
      means in the front when you upload you will be prompted to add a name or anonymous

    maybe add cron or a system to have the zip already made.
        => after 30 mins of nothing uploaded on the folder and different hash.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGFIXES

check if when we create image with same name it works ==> no it doesnt.
    check if when we create image with same name of a deleted one, it works, because then
    if we delete the new one it will try to have the same name as the deleted.

if we have two folder with same name we can't have two different zips in the bucket.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOWEST

primary key in the link when in a folder ?
put links of the cloud run services in env
add database columns for like folderName, etc.
    filtre photo/video/both avec un triple slider, middle/left/right avec middle include les deux
