FULLY AUTOMATIC BUG MOST IMPORTANT

    if two pictures same name they get same name in google cloud and override the other

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOP PRIORITY

    the zip must not be created again if the content hasn't changed.

    add a loading when uploading photos and find a wayto close instant the add files.

    preload_little versions before clicking on them, fetch the big version one by one with 3 in advance.
        subtasks:
            -   create a cloud run service to make a thumbnail.
            -   should create a thumbnail for videos too.
            -   maybe find a way to show a loading time.
            -   deleting a picture should delete the thumbnail too.

    make the soft delete for everyone
        ask name when delete
        just ask if they are sure or not, too.

    the zip thing
        cloud run

     fix sur le pc et meme peut etre sur le tel quand on regarde une video faut pas que la barre
            en bas elle empeche de pouvoir appuyer sur les boutons.

    add security by making a signed url for each pictures and each thumbnail and each zip.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOW PRIORITY

    add the date in the preview, aswell as size
      means adding size and date to media schema in db, aswell as everywhere else

    add uploader in the preview too
      means adding uploader to media schema in db, as well as everywhere else
      means in the front when you upload you will be prompted to add a name or anonymous

    filtre photo/video/both avec un triple slider, middle/left/right avec middle include les deux

    add database columns for like folderName, etc.

    load the photos before videos.

    maybe add cron or a system to have the zip already made.

BUGFIXES

check if when we create image with same name it works ==> no it doesnt.
    check if when we create image with same name of a deleted one, it works, because then
    if we delete the new one it will try to have the same name as the deleted.

if we have two folder with same name we can't have two different zips in the bucket.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOWEST

primary key in the link when in a folder ?
put links of the cloud run services in env
